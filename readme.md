### About the app
The app is meant to become a sort of a “wiki” or reference for “heroes” from the show ‘One Punch Man’. The app allows you to contribute in populating, as well as, correcting and removing information on these “heroes”.

### UX

**The project’s target market**: This website/app is intended to become a sort of reference or guide to characters, specifically, “heroes” from the show One Punch Man and is hence intended for an audience that likes the show One Punch Man and would like to know about the characters.

**What my target audience wants to achieve**: The target audience is people who really enjoy the show One Punch Man and they would like to contribute to a stylised collection of hero “cards”, which contain information about heroes from the show.

**The Font**: The choice to go with the ‘Bangers’ font from Google fonts was deliberate. The idea was to bring a comic book aesthetic to the presentation of the website. I felt that the ‘Bangers’ font struck a good balance between legibility and the style I was going for well enough to make it look fun, yet, functionally effective at the same time.

**Wireframes**
Wireframing was done using Adobe XD.  Here is a link to the wireframes: [wireframes](https://github.com/ablshk/herodb/tree/master/wireframes)
